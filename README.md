# Infomation Visualization
- This repo showcases our implementation procedure of the project in the course - Information Visualization at University of Amsterdam on 2021.
- The workflow of our implementation shows <a href="https://github.com/DanferWang/InfoVis_team06/blob/main/Framework_UsingLeaflet/README.md" target="_blank">here</a>.
- The following parts record our idea, modification, and TA's feedback.

## Week 2 (11/2/21)

**Three primitive ideas**

- OmniArt: combine multiple pictures together to create a new picture.
- Geographic heatmap of a city.
- Categorizing paintings by time, artist, etc.

**TA's Response:**

- Social demographic datasets are available on the World Bank website.
- You have to determine the goals of visualization, such as calculating some ratios which are not visible by looking at the data itself.

**Tasks due nextweek:**

1. Create a team repo on Github
2. Take meeting notes
3. Provide slides for next week

## Week 3 (18/2/21)

**Present and elaborate two ideas we chose last week**

**Two elaborate ideas**

- **Online Gallery:** Create a online gallery with OmniArt dataset using filter function and some trends we find.
- **Where do you wanna live after retiring?** Offer several indicators for user to allocate weight so that our application could return an Area or a country match the user's need. Furthermore, show the result precisely on the world map in our webpage.

**TA's Response:**

- Recommend that we could go for the second one.
- The second idea is more suitable to Visual Analytic project.

**Tasks due nextweek:**

1. Prepare a prototype
	- Providing pdf, showing where each component should be placed
	- Share the screen and run the server to show the wireframe at nextweek meeting
2. Dataset
	- Make sure we have dataset ready
	- Upload them to our Github repo



## Week 4 (25/2/21)

**Present our initial information visualization demo**

**Ask which dataset we should choose: World or Europe**

**TA's Response:**

- Change the current layout to improve visualization
- Europe dataset is enough
- Good job for now

**Tasks due nextweek:**

1. Change the current layout according to something like Airbnb's website
   - Remove the title
   - Remove the number and put slider on the top
   - Put ranking result on the left
   - Put map on the right
   - Add a legend
2. Find the missing data we need



## Week 5 (4/3/21)

**Present our datasets, model and web interface**

- The interaction between the front end and the back end is not completed.

**TA's Response:**

- Make the interface more recognizable
- Pay more attention to fine details, aethetic features and usability

**Tasks due nextweek:**

1. Remove the submit botton and add on-change handler for all the control
2. Color code/Attributes
3. Branding: Use piechart-like control system to help users identify and control each indicator.
4. Hover: After selecting a country in the barchart, highlight the corresponding area on the map 
5. Keep historical results and make comparison: use sesssion storage
6. Add a legend to the map to explain it

## Week 6 (11/3/21)

**Present our webpage, and with Flask backend**

- The interaction between the front end and the back end has some bugs to fix.

**TA's Response:**

- some advice for fixing the bugs
- better arrangement and interaction on pie chart and slider

**Tasks due nextweek:**

1. Wheel(Pie chart) on top
2. Real time slider,change in real time 
3. move the sliders to bottom
4. slider wider, whole width 
5. Result scores(bar chart), fix it on the back end (real time)
6. legends and redrawing (map)

## Week 7
