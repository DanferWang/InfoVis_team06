# Infomation Visualization
Information Visualization team 06 project progress.

## Week 2 (11/2/21)

**Three primitive ideas**

- OmniArt: combine multiple pictures together to create a new picture.
- Geographic heatmap of a city.
- Categorizing paintings by time, artist, etc.

**TA's Response:**

- Social demographic datasets are available on the World Bank website.
- You have to determine the goals of visualization, such as calculating some ratios which are not visible by looking at the data itself.

**Tasks due nextweek:**

1. Create a team repo on Github
2. Take meeting notes
3. Provide slides for next week

## Week 3 (18/2/21)

**Present and elaborate two ideas we chose last week**

**Two elaborate ideas**

- **Online Gallery:** Create a online gallery with OmniArt dataset using filter function and some trends we find.
- **Where do you wanna live after retiring?** Offer several indicators for user to allocate weight so that our application could return an Area or a country match the user's need. Furthermore, show the result precisely on the world map in our webpage.

**TA's Response:**

- Recommend that we could go for the second one.
- The second idea is more suitable to Visual Analytic project.

**Tasks due nextweek**

1. Prepare a prototype
	- Providing pdf, showing where each component should be placed
	- Share the screen and run the server to show the wireframe at nextweek meeting
2. Dataset
	- Make sure we have dataset ready
	- Upload them to our Github repo



## Week 4 (25/2/21)

**Present our initial information visualization demo**

**Ask which dataset we should choose: World or Europe**

**TA's Response:**

- Change the current layout to improve visualization
- Europe dataset is enough
- Good job for now

**Tasks due nextweek**

1. Change the current layout according to something like Airbnb's website
   - Remove the title
   - Remove the number and put slider on the top
   - Put ranking result on the left
   - Put map on the right
   - Add a legend
2. Find the missing data we need



## Week 5 (4/3/21)

**Present our datasets, model and web interface**

- The interaction between the front end and the back end is not completed.

**TA's Response:**

- Make the interface more recognizable
- Pay more attention to fine details, aethetic features and usability

**Tasks due nextweek**

1. Remove the submit botton and add on-change handler for all the control
2. Color code/Attributes
3. Branding: Use piechart-like control system to help users identify and control each indicator.
4. Hover: After selecting a country in the barchart, highlight the corresponding area on the map 
5. Keep historical results and make comparison: use sesssion storage
6. Add a legend to the map to explain it
